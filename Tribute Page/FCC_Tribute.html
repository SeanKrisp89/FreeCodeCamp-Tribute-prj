            has given his best effort, who has tried the hardest they possibly can, who has utilized every ounce of energy and strength 
            within them to accomplish something. It doesn't mean that they accomplished it or failed, it means that they've given it their best. 
            That's a winner.”<br><br>-- Walter Payton
